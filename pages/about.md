# About this website
## The "MotherFuckingWebsite" part
This website is perfect. :relieved::nail_care:
	- Shit's complex yet not even 1% of this size of the average websites *probably*.
	- Shit made of Markdown and turned into HTML with my own tool.
	- What's the problem with Github Pages? It removes your fucking cost to maintain the website that no one uses.
	- Give each character to breath. `line-height: 1.5` is the best.
	- Uses the Rubik font for text and `Cascadia Code` for code - the perfect combination.
	- Give your eyeball some love. Will any Internet users move their eyeballs frequently to look at websites? Limit your content to `30cm` or less.
	- Use fancy math things! $E = mc^2$ is better than E = mc^2. *Who has a builtin latex compiler in their head*.
